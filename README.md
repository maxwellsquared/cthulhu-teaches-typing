## About The Project


Cthulhu Teaches Typing is a typing game for learning to type. It is a work in progress, and is currently in the beta stage of development.

Our goal was to target the keyboard enthusiast market with a minimal, yet customizable application to track and compare typing statistics. We also wanted to create a fun and engaging typing game that would help users learn to type faster and more accurately.

We hope you enjoy it!
